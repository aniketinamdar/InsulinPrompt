# Insulin Prompt on the basis of Blood Sugar Levels
##  Introduction
* Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels in the body by helping glucose move from the bloodstream into cells where it can be used for energy. The amount of insulin needed varies depending on a person's blood sugar level, as well as other factors such as their weight, diet, and activity level.
* It's important to note that insulin recommendations can vary depending on the individual and their specific medical situation. People with diabetes should work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best insulin regimen for their needs.
* It is an implementation of Naives Bayes Classifier to recommend insulin dosage according to their blood sugar levels.
* Please note, take your medicines as prescribed by the doctor.
